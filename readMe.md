## Learning Pygame library by making Tetris

This project is my attempt to make some game using pygame. I've decided to write Tetris because it's my favorite web game and it doesn't need much graphics to look good. Code isn't perfect and clean however it gets the job done and in free time I will try to upgrade it. I've tried my best to avoid magic numbers.

## Still few things to do:
- improve hold/nextShape rectangles
- add audio

## Setup

To run this game you need two things:
1) Python 
    Download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2) Pygame library
    Open your terminal and type:
    ```
    pip install pygame
    ```
