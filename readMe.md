## Learning Pygame library by making Tetris

This project is my attempt to make some game using pygame. I've decided to code Tetris, because it's my favorite web game and it doesn't need much graphics to look good. Code isn't perfect however it gets the job done and in free time I will try my best to upgrade it. Attention, few magic numbers appears!

## Still few things to do:
- improve hold/nextShape rectangles

## Setup

To run this game you need two things:
1) Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2) Pygame library; open your terminal and type:
```
pip install pygame
```
